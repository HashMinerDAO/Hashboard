# Active Context: Hashboard Development

## Current Work Focus

### Memory Bank Initialization
- ✅ Created core memory bank structure with all required files
- ✅ Established documentation hierarchy and workflows
- ✅ Set up persistent storage for project knowledge

### Immediate Priorities
- Review and validate existing codebase structure
- Identify key integration points with middleware APIs
- Establish development environment consistency

## Recent Changes
- **2025-10-31**: Memory bank initialized with complete core file structure
- **2025-10-31**: Created documentation framework for session continuity

## Next Steps

### Short Term (This Session)
1. Analyze current Vue.js application structure
2. Review API integration patterns
3. Document existing component architecture
4. Identify potential refactoring opportunities

### Medium Term
1. Implement governance voting interface
2. Enhance wallet integration features
3. Optimize data synchronization performance
4. Add comprehensive error handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
- **Composition API**: All new components should use Vue 3 Composition API
- **State Management**: Vuex store for global state, local state for components
- **API Integration**: Centralized service layer for all external API calls

### Development Practices
- **Code Style**: ESLint configuration enforced across all files
- **Testing**: Vitest framework for unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Memory bank updates required for significant changes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Component Structure
```
ComponentName.vue
├── <template> - Single root element
├── <script setup> - Composition API with TypeScript
├── <style scoped> - Component-scoped styles
└── Proper prop typing and emit definitions
```

### State Management
- Actions for async operations and API calls
- Mutations for synchronous state updates
- Getters for computed state access
- Modular store structure by feature

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for API calls
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Graceful degradation for failed data loads

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Debt Areas
- Some components still use Options API (migration needed)
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Potential optimization opportunities in data fetching

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets require pagination/virtualization
- Real-time updates need efficient caching strategies
- Bundle size optimization for production builds

### User Experience Insights
- Mobile responsiveness critical for community engagement
- Clear loading states essential for data-heavy interface
- Progressive disclosure helps manage information complexity
