# Product Context: Hashboard

## Why Hashboard Exists

The Zettahash DAO requires complete transparency to maintain community trust and enable informed decision-making. Traditional financial dashboards lack the comprehensive view needed for a mining operation DAO, particularly one spanning multiple blockchains and mining operations.

Hashboard solves this by providing a unified, real-time view of all Zettahash operations, financials, and governance activities in one accessible interface.

## Problems Solved

### Information Asymmetry
- **Problem**: Community members lack access to real-time operational data
- **Solution**: Centralized dashboard with live data feeds from all mining operations

### Complex Multi-Chain Operations
- **Problem**: Zettahash operates across multiple blockchains (ETH, BTC, Linecoin) with different monitoring requirements
- **Solution**: Unified interface aggregating data from all chains and operations

### Governance Participation Barriers
- **Problem**: Low community participation in governance due to complex proposal processes
- **Solution**: Integrated governance tools with clear proposal visualization and voting interfaces

### Financial Transparency
- **Problem**: Difficulty tracking treasury movements and vesting schedules
- **Solution**: Real-time wallet monitoring and vesting schedule visualization

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User lands on public dashboard with key metrics visible
2. **Connection**: Wallet connection reveals personalized data (balances, vesting)
3. **Exploration**: Navigate through mining data, financials, and governance
4. **Participation**: Engage with community forum and governance proposals
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts and track favorite metrics

### Data Flow
```
Mining Operations → Middleware API → Hashboard → User Interface
Financial Data    → GraphQL APIs   → Real-time Updates
Governance        → Snapshot       → Voting Interface
Community         → Forum Backend  → Discussion Threads
```
